## Testing
- App successfully builds and runs on Windows
- All navigation items work correctly
- Responsive layouts adapt properly to different screen sizes

## Notes
- State management not implemented (as requested)
- Button actions are placeholder functions
- Data is hardcoded with sample values
- Filters, search, and interactive elements are UI-only (non-functional)
- Focus is on UI design and responsiveness, not functionality

## Next Steps for Full Implementation
1. Implement state management with Riverpod
2. Add data models with Freezed
3. Implement local storage/database
4. Connect button actions to actual functionality
5. Add form validation
6. Implement search and filter logic
7. Add animations and transitions
8. Implement timer functionality
9. Add data persistence
10. Implement chart libraries for better visualizations

## Running the App
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows  # or your preferred device
```

The app will launch with the development flavor by default, showing the Dashboard screen with full navigation capabilities.
